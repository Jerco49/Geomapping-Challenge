# Geomapping-Challenge
Geomapping assignment using Mapbox for the Rutgers Data Science Boot Camp.

Note that this code uses an API key from Mapbox.com.  To view the visualization of this code, create a mapbox account and grab the public API key to be inserted into logic.js under API_KEY.  Then, using command-line, go to the directory containing index.html and run a python server by typing python -m http.server.  Finally, open your web browser and go to localhost:8000 to load the data.  The map will take a while to load due to the large amount of data being mapped.

See "Earthquake Map Example.png" to see an example of the code at work.
